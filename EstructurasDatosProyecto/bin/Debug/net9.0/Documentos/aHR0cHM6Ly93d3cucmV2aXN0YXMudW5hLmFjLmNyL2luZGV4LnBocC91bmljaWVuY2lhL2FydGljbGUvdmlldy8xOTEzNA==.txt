					Abstract
					[Objective] This study aimed to implement 3D image acquisition and postprocessing tools for the natural heritage preservation of a collection of craniums from a zoology museum and a wildlife rescue center.  [Methodology] Samples were prepared following osteotechnics protocols developed at the rescue center. They were then digitized in a darkroom using a metrology-grade 3D scanner. Meshes were optimized for both fabrication and visualization purposes. Subsequently, some of the models were printed at a university makerspace using three different technologies to be measured and analyzed with the metrology capabilities of inspection software; the purpose was to determine which technology provided the most accurate replicas.[Results] The results demonstrated that the three technologies produced high-quality replicas. However, those based on optical processes (SLA and material jetting) generated more accurate physical models, which are of particular interest for scientific fields, such as zooarchaeology, paleontology, biology, and veterinary medicine. These fields could benefit from training and learning experiences supported by these digital asset collections. The models were successfully adapted to be uploaded to a 3D viewer platform, which is compatible with low-cost virtual reality solutions, to implement them in environmental education activities. [Conclusions] The experience demonstrates that photogrammetry and 3D scanning are feasible solutions to preserve high-value samples of scientific and historical interest composed of biological materials exposed to degradation by environmental conditions. It also provides new digital assets to foster outreach and educational activities for universities, museums, and rescue centers.
